   <big> <h2>Early Life and Work</h2>
<img src="brahmagupta1.png" alt="loading..." width="400" height="400" border="10" align="right"/>

    <p><strong>Birth:</strong> Brahmagupta was born in 598 CE, likely in <em>Bhillamala</em> (modern-day Rajasthan, India), during the Gupta period, a time known for significant advancements in science and mathematics.</p>


    <p><strong>Patronage:</strong> He was the head of an <em>astronomical observatory</em> in <em>Ujjain</em>, a prominent center for ancient Indian astronomy, which allowed him to make significant contributions in both mathematics and astronomy.</p>
</section>

    <h2>Major Contributions in Mathematics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> Brahmagupta is often called the <em>Father of Algebra</em> for his systematic approach to solving <em>linear and quadratic equations</em>. He was one of the first to work with <em>negative numbers</em>, and he outlined rules for their use in mathematical operations, including how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide them.</li>
        <li><strong>Quadratic Equations:</strong> Brahmagupta provided a general solution for quadratic equations of the form <em>axÂ² + bx + c = 0</em>. He introduced methods for determining the roots of such equations, which were groundbreaking in algebraic solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Geometry:</strong> He made significant contributions to the geometry of <em>cyclic quadrilaterals</em> (four-sided polygons where all vertices lie on a common circle). His work in geometry formed a basis for later developments in <em>trigonometry</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic Progressions:</strong> Brahmagupta worked on <em>sequences</em>, especially <em>arithmetic progressions</em> (sequences where each term is derived by adding a constant to the previous term). He developed methods to calculate the sum of arithmetic progressions, a critical concept in number theory.</li>

        <li><strong>Number Theory:</strong> Brahmagupta made pioneering contributions to <em>number theory</em>, especially in understanding properties of numbers, divisibility, and the <em>solutions to Diophantine equations</em> (equations that seek integer solutions).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Contributions to Astronomy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Planetary Motion:</strong> Brahmagupta made critical contributions to understanding the <em>motion of planets</em>, including their positions and movements in the sky.</li>
        <li><strong>Solar and Lunar Eclipses:</strong> He developed methods to predict <em>solar and lunar eclipses</em> with remarkable accuracy, calculating their timings and durations.</li>
        <li><strong>Earth and the Universe:</strong> Brahmagupta postulated that the <em>Earth was spherical</em> and moved in space, countering the earlier belief that the Earth was flat. He also suggested that the Earth's motion was due to the interaction of various forces.</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational Theory:</strong> Brahmagupta had an early understanding of what we now consider <em>gravity</em>. He observed that objects fall toward the Earth, which is a fundamental concept of gravitational attraction.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>Influence and Legacy</h2>
    <p>Brahmagupta's work influenced not only <em>India</em>, but also the <em>Islamic world</em> and <em>Europe</em>. His theories on <em>algebra</em>, <em>geometry</em>, and <em>number theory</em> were foundational to later mathematicians in both the Eastern and Western worlds.</p>
    <p>His contributions, particularly his work on <em>zero</em>, algebra, and number theory, are considered critical to the development of <em>mathematics</em> and <em>astronomy</em> as we know them today.</p>
